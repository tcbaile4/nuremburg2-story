I was invited down to the ratskellar after work today. 
I wish they would have turned on the Klimaanlage. 
Without a Klimaanlage it would be nicer to sit outside in a Biergarten. 
It was then that I had a Schnapsidee.
What if I just took a trip to the flughafen instead?
They have the best Bratwurst there!
I'll head up the Hauptstrasse.
On the way, I saw a Luftschloss off in the distance.  They also have the best musik there!
